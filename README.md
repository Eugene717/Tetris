# Tetris
Windows Tetris is a classic puzzle game where players must manipulate falling blocks of various shapes to form complete horizontal lines without any gaps. As the game progresses, the blocks fall faster, increasing the challenge, and ending the game when the stack reaches the top of the screen.

## Gameplay:
- Blocks of different shapes fall from the top of the screen.
- The player must rotate and move the blocks to create horizontal lines without any gaps.
- When a line is completed, it disappears, and the player earns points.
- The game speeds up as the player progresses, making it harder to keep up with the falling blocks.
- The game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the screen, and there is no room to place new blocks.
